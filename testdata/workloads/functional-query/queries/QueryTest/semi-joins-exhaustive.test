---- QUERY
# Regression test for IMPALA-2256. Join whose right side has high cardinality and
# zero materialized slots. Because the right side of the join here is always the
# same key, this query can run out of memory and fail to spill; see IMPALA-4856.
# The cardinality (~12M) is chosen so that the test run successfully in parallel
# with other tests when impalad has a 7.8GB memlimit. (The peak memory usage of
# the relevant fragment is ~850MB when tested.)
