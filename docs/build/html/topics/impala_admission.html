      Admission control is an Impala feature that imposes limits on concurrent SQL queries, to avoid resource usage
      spikes and out-of-memory conditions on busy clusters.
      It is a form of <span class="q">"throttling"</span>.
      New queries are accepted and executed until
      certain conditions are met, such as too many queries or too much
      total memory used across the cluster.
      When one of these thresholds is reached,
      incoming queries wait to begin execution. These queries are
      queued and are admitted (that is, begin executing) when the resources become available.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      In addition to the threshold values for currently executing queries,
      you can place limits on the maximum number of queries that are
      queued (waiting) and a limit on the amount of time they might wait
      before returning with an error. These queue settings let you ensure that queries do
      not wait indefinitely, so that you can detect and correct <span class="q">"starvation"</span> scenarios.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Enable this feature if your cluster is
      underutilized at some times and overutilized at others. Overutilization is indicated by performance
      bottlenecks and queries being cancelled due to out-of-memory conditions, when those same queries are
      successful and perform well during times with less concurrent load. Admission control works as a safeguard to
      avoid out-of-memory conditions during heavy concurrent usage.

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        On a busy cluster, you might find there is an optimal number of Impala queries that run concurrently.
        For example, when the I/O capacity is fully utilized by I/O-intensive queries,
        you might not find any throughput benefit in running more concurrent queries.
        By allowing some queries to run at full speed while others wait, rather than having
        all queries contend for resources and run slowly, admission control can result in higher overall throughput.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        For another example, consider a memory-bound workload such as many large joins or aggregation queries.
        Each such query could briefly use many gigabytes of memory to process intermediate results.
        Because Impala by default cancels queries that exceed the specified memory limit,
        running multiple large-scale queries at once might require
        re-running some queries that are cancelled. In this case, admission control improves the
        reliability and stability of the overall workload by only allowing as many concurrent queries
        as the overall memory of the cluster can accomodate.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        The admission control feature lets you set an upper limit on the number of concurrent Impala
        queries and on the memory used by those queries. Any additional queries are queued until the earlier ones
        finish, rather than being cancelled or running slowly and causing contention. As other queries finish, the
        queued queries are allowed to proceed.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        In <span class="keyword">Impala 2.5</span> and higher, you can specify these limits and thresholds for each
        pool rather than globally. That way, you can balance the resource usage and throughput
        between steady well-defined workloads, rare resource-intensive queries, and ad hoc
        exploratory queries.

        One way to limit resource usage through admission control is to set an upper limit
        on the number of concurrent queries. This is the initial technique you might use
        when you do not have extensive information about memory usage for your workload.
        This setting can be specified separately for each dynamic resource pool.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        You can combine this setting with the memory-based approach described in
        <a class="xref" href="impala_admission.html#admission_memory">Memory Limits and Admission Control</a>. If either the maximum number of
        or the expected memory usage of the concurrent queries is exceeded, subsequent queries

        Each dynamic resource pool can have an upper limit on the cluster-wide memory used by queries executing in that pool.
        This is the technique to use once you have a stable workload with well-understood memory requirements.

      <p class="p">
        Always specify the <span class="ph uicontrol">Default Query Memory Limit</span> for the expected maximum amount of RAM
        that a query might require on each host, which is equivalent to setting the <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code>
        query option for every query run in that pool. That value affects the execution of each query, preventing it
        from overallocating memory on each host, and potentially activating the spill-to-disk mechanism or cancelling
        the query when necessary.

      <p class="p">
        Optionally, specify the <span class="ph uicontrol">Max Memory</span> setting, a cluster-wide limit that determines

        number of Impala nodes in the cluster.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title5">How Impala Admission Control Relates to Other Resource Management Tools</h2>
  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The admission control feature is similar in some ways to the YARN resource management framework. These features
        can be used separately or together. This section describes some similarities and differences, to help you
        decide which combination of resource management features to use for Impala.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        Admission control is a lightweight, decentralized system that is suitable for workloads consisting
        primarily of Impala queries and other SQL statements. It sets <span class="q">"soft"</span> limits that smooth out Impala
        memory usage during times of heavy load, rather than taking an all-or-nothing approach that cancels jobs
        that are too resource-intensive.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        Because the admission control system does not interact with other Hadoop workloads such as MapReduce jobs, you
        might use YARN with static service pools on clusters where resources are shared between
        Impala and other Hadoop components. This configuration is recommended when using Impala in a
        <dfn class="term">multitenant</dfn> cluster. Devote a percentage of cluster resources to Impala, and allocate another
        percentage for MapReduce and other batch-style workloads. Let admission control handle the concurrency and
        memory usage for the Impala work within the cluster, and let YARN manage the work for other components within the
        cluster. In this scenario, Impala's resources are not managed by YARN.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        The Impala admission control feature uses the same configuration mechanism as the YARN resource manager to map users to
        pools and authenticate them.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        Although the Impala admission control feature uses a <code class="ph codeph">fair-scheduler.xml</code> configuration file
        behind the scenes, this file does not depend on which scheduler is used for YARN. You still use this file
        even when YARN is using the capacity scheduler.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title6">How Impala Schedules and Enforces Limits on Concurrent Queries</h2>
  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        The admission control system is decentralized, embedded in each Impala daemon and communicating through the
        statestore mechanism. Although the limits you set for memory usage and number of concurrent queries apply
        cluster-wide, each Impala daemon makes its own decisions about whether to allow each query to run
        immediately or to queue it for a less-busy time. These decisions are fast, meaning the admission control
        mechanism is low-overhead, but might be imprecise during times of heavy load across many coordinators. There could be times when the
        more queries were queued (in aggregate across the cluster) than the specified limit, or when number of admitted queries
        exceeds the expected number. Thus, you typically err on the
        high side for the size of the queue, because there is not a big penalty for having a large number of queued
        queries; and you typically err on the low side for configuring memory resources, to leave some headroom in case more
        queries are admitted than expected, without running out of memory and being cancelled as a result.
      </p>



      <p class="p">
        To avoid a large backlog of queued requests, you can set an upper limit on the size of the queue for
        queries that are queued. When the number of queued queries exceeds this limit, further queries are
        cancelled rather than being queued. You can also configure a timeout period per pool, after which queued queries are
        cancelled, to avoid indefinite waits. If a cluster reaches this state where queries are cancelled due to
        too many concurrent requests or long waits for query execution to begin, that is a signal for an
        administrator to take action, either by provisioning more resources, scheduling work on the cluster to
        smooth out the load, or by doing <a class="xref" href="impala_performance.html#performance">Impala performance
        tuning</a> to enable higher throughput.

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title7">How Admission Control works with Impala Clients (JDBC, ODBC, HiveServer2)</h2>
  

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        Most aspects of admission control work transparently with client interfaces such as JDBC and ODBC:
      </p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          If a SQL statement is put into a queue rather than running immediately, the API call blocks until the
          statement is dequeued and begins execution. At that point, the client program can request to fetch
          results, which might also block until results become available.
        </li>

        <li class="li">
          If a SQL statement is cancelled because it has been queued for too long or because it exceeded the memory
          limit during execution, the error is returned to the client program with a descriptive error message.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">
        In Impala 2.0 and higher, you can submit
        a SQL <code class="ph codeph">SET</code> statement from the client application
        to change the <code class="ph codeph">REQUEST_POOL</code> query option.
        This option lets you submit queries to different resource pools,
        as described in <a class="xref" href="impala_request_pool.html#request_pool">REQUEST_POOL Query Option</a>.

      </p>

      <p class="p">
        At any time, the set of queued queries could include queries submitted through multiple different Impala
        daemon hosts. All the queries submitted through a particular host will be executed in order, so a
        <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE</code> followed by an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> on the same table would succeed.
        Queries submitted through different hosts are not guaranteed to be executed in the order they were
        received. Therefore, if you are using load-balancing or other round-robin scheduling where different
        statements are submitted through different hosts, set up all table structures ahead of time so that the
        statements controlled by the queuing system are primarily queries, where order is not significant. Or, if a
        sequence of statements needs to happen in strict order (such as an <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> followed by a
        <code class="ph codeph">SELECT</code>), submit all those statements through a single session, while connected to the same
        Impala daemon host.

      <p class="p">
        When queries complete quickly and are tuned for optimal memory usage, there is less chance of
        performance or capacity problems during times of heavy load. Before setting up admission control,
        tune your Impala queries to ensure that the query plans are efficient and the memory estimates
        are accurate. Understanding the nature of your workload, and which queries are the most
        resource-intensive, helps you to plan how to divide the queries into different pools and
        decide what limits to define for each pool.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        For large tables, especially those involved in join queries, keep their statistics up to date
        after loading substantial amounts of new data or adding new partitions.
        Use the <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement for unpartitioned tables, and
        <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</code> for partitioned tables.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        When you use dynamic resource pools with a <span class="ph uicontrol">Max Memory</span> setting enabled,
        you typically override the memory estimates that Impala makes based on the statistics from the
        <code class="ph codeph">COMPUTE STATS</code> statement.
        You either set the <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code> query option within a particular session to
        set an upper memory limit for queries within that session, or a default <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code>
        setting for all queries processed by the <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> instance, or
        a default <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code> setting for all queries assigned to a particular
        dynamic resource pool. By designating a consistent memory limit for a set of similar queries
        that use the same resource pool, you avoid unnecessary query queuing or out-of-memory conditions
        that can arise during high-concurrency workloads when memory estimates for some queries are inaccurate.

      <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">
          To configure admission control, use a combination of startup options for the Impala daemon and edit

            <span class="ph filepath">llama-site.xml</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          For a straightforward configuration using a single resource pool named <code class="ph codeph">default</code>, you can

          and <span class="ph filepath">llama-site.xml</span> configuration files.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          For an advanced configuration with multiple resource pools using different settings, set up the
          <span class="ph filepath">fair-scheduler.xml</span> and <span class="ph filepath">llama-site.xml</span> configuration files
          manually. Provide the paths to each one using the <span class="keyword cmdname">impalad</span> command-line options,
          <code class="ph codeph">--fair_scheduler_allocation_path</code> and <code class="ph codeph">--llama_site_path</code> respectively.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          The Impala admission control feature only uses the Fair Scheduler configuration settings to determine how
          to map users and groups to different resource pools. For example, you might set up different resource
          pools with separate memory limits, and maximum number of concurrent and queued queries, for different
          categories of users within your organization. For details about all the Fair Scheduler configuration
          settings, see the

       MEM_LIMIT takes a per-node memory limit which is specified using one of the following:

        - '&lt;float&gt;[mM(bB)]' -&gt; megabytes
        - '&lt;float&gt;[gG(bB)]' -&gt; in gigabytes
        E.g. 'MEM_LIMIT=12345' (no unit) means 12345 bytes, and you can append m or g
             to specify megabytes or gigabytes, though that is not required.

    <div class="body conbody">

      <p class="p">
        To see how admission control works for particular queries, examine the profile output for the query. This
        information is available through the <code class="ph codeph">PROFILE</code> statement in <span class="keyword cmdname">impala-shell</span>
        immediately after running a query in the shell, on the <span class="ph uicontrol">queries</span> page of the Impala
        debug web UI, or in the Impala log file (basic information at log level 1, more detailed information at log
        level 2). The profile output contains details about the admission decision, such as whether the query was
        queued or not and which resource pool it was assigned to. It also includes the estimated and actual memory
        usage for the query, so you can fine-tune the configuration for the memory limits of the resource pools.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        Remember that the limits imposed by admission control are <span class="q">"soft"</span> limits.
        The decentralized nature of this mechanism means that each Impala node makes its own decisions about whether
        to allow queries to run immediately or to queue them. These decisions rely on information passed back and forth
        between nodes by the statestore service. If a sudden surge in requests causes more queries than anticipated to run
        concurrently, then throughput could decrease due to queries spilling to disk or contending for resources;
        or queries could be cancelled if they exceed the <code class="ph codeph">MEM_LIMIT</code> setting while running.
      </p>



      <p class="p">
        In <span class="keyword cmdname">impala-shell</span>, you can also specify which resource pool to direct queries to by
        setting the <code class="ph codeph">REQUEST_POOL</code> query option.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        The statements affected by the admission control feature are primarily queries, but also include statements
        that write data such as <code class="ph codeph">INSERT</code> and <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</code>. Most write
        operations in Impala are not resource-intensive, but inserting into a Parquet table can require substantial
        memory due to buffering intermediate data before writing out each Parquet data block. See
        <a class="xref" href="impala_parquet.html#parquet_etl">Loading Data into Parquet Tables</a> for instructions about inserting data efficiently into
        Parquet tables.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        Although admission control does not scrutinize memory usage for other kinds of DDL statements, if a query
        is queued due to a limit on concurrent queries or memory usage, subsequent statements in the same session
        are also queued so that they are processed in the correct order:
      </p>

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>-- This query could be queued to avoid out-of-memory at times of heavy load.
select * from huge_table join enormous_table using (id);
-- If so, this subsequent statement in the same session is also queued
-- until the previous statement completes.
drop table huge_table;
</code></pre>

        If you set up different resource pools for different users and groups, consider reusing any classifications
        you developed for use with Sentry security. See <a class="xref" href="impala_authorization.html#authorization">Enabling Sentry Authorization for Impala</a> for details.
