      Depending on how busy your <span class="keyword"></span> cluster is, you might increase or decrease various timeout
      values. Increase timeouts if Impala is cancelling operations prematurely, when the system
      is responding slower than usual but the operations are still successful if given extra
      time. Decrease timeouts if operations are idle or hanging for long periods, and the idle
      or hung operations are consuming resources and reducing concurrency.

      <p class="p">
        If you have an extensive Impala schema, for example with hundreds of databases, tens of
        thousands of tables, and so on, you might encounter timeout errors during startup as the
        Impala catalog service broadcasts metadata to all the Impala nodes using the statestore
        service. To avoid such timeout errors on startup, increase the statestore timeout value
        from its default of 10 seconds. Specify the timeout value using the
        <code class="ph codeph">-statestore_subscriber_timeout_seconds</code> option for the statestore
        service, using the configuration instructions in
        <a class="xref" href="impala_config_options.html#config_options">Modifying Impala Startup Options</a>. The symptom of this problem is
        messages in the <code class="ph codeph">impalad</code> log such as:

<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>Connection with state-store lost
Trying to re-register with state-store</code></pre>

    <div class="body conbody">

        To keep long-running queries or idle sessions from tying up cluster resources, you can
        set timeout intervals for both individual queries, and entire sessions.

      <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title notetitle">Note:</span>

          The timeout clock for queries and sessions only starts ticking when the query or session is idle.
          For queries, this means the query has results ready but is waiting for a client to fetch the data. A
          query can run for an arbitrary time without triggering a timeout, because the query is computing results
          rather than sitting idle waiting for the results to be fetched. The timeout period is intended to prevent
          unclosed queries from consuming resources and taking up slots in the admission count of running queries,
          potentially preventing other queries from starting.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          For sessions, this means that no query has been submitted for some period of time.

            The <code class="ph codeph">--idle_query_timeout</code> option specifies the time in seconds after
            which an idle query is cancelled. This could be a query whose results were all fetched
            but was never closed, or one whose results were partially fetched and then the client
            program stopped requesting further results. This condition is most likely to occur in
            a client program using the JDBC or ODBC interfaces, rather than in the interactive
            <span class="keyword cmdname">impala-shell</span> interpreter. Once the query is cancelled, the client
            program cannot retrieve any further results.

            You can reduce the idle query timeout by using the <code class="ph codeph">QUERY_TIMEOUT_S</code>
            query option. Any non-zero value specified for the <code class="ph codeph">--idle_query_timeout</code> startup
            option serves as an upper limit for the <code class="ph codeph">QUERY_TIMEOUT_S</code> query option.
            A zero value for <code class="ph codeph">--idle_query_timeout</code> disables query timeouts.

            any of the queries in that session, and the session has not started any new queries.
            Once a session is expired, you cannot issue any new query requests to it. The session
            remains open, but the only operation you can perform is to close it. The default value
            of 0 means that sessions never expire.

          the specified configuration setting. For example, if the timeout setting was 60, the
          session or query might be cancelled after being idle between 60 and 90 seconds.
